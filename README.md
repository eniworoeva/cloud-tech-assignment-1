# Assignment 1

During development the server will be available under http://localhost:8080, with endpoints

 * http://localhost:8080/unisearcher/v1/uniinfo/
 * http://localhost:8080/unisearcher/v1/neighbourunis/
 * http://localhost:8080/unisearcher/v1/diag/

Afterwards it'll be deployed to Heroku and can be used freely (hopefully :D )
